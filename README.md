# Git & GitHub Collaboration Demo - Software Engineering Community

This repository was created for a session with the Software Engineering Community of the University of Ghana to demonstrate Git, GitHub, and collaborative workflows.

## Session Topic: Git, GitHub, and Collaboration

The primary goal of this session was to introduce students to the fundamentals of version control with Git and how to leverage GitHub for effective collaboration on software projects. Key concepts covered likely included:

*   **Git Basics:** Understanding repositories, commits, staging, branching, and merging.
*   **GitHub Flow:** Using GitHub for hosting repositories, managing branches, creating pull requests, and conducting code reviews.
*   **Collaboration:** How multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously, manage conflicts, and contribute to a shared codebase.

## Repository Structure

The project in this repository is a simple landing page. It consists of the following files:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure and content of the webpage.
*   `styles.css`: The CSS file that provides the styling and visual appearance for the webpage.
*   `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity and dynamic features to the webpage.

## Branches

### The `main` branch
In Git, branches are used to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with new ideas in isolation without affecting the main codebase. The `main` branch in this repository holds the primary version of the project, which is typically the stable and production-ready code.

### Other Branches (e.g., `testing-branch`)
During the session, the use of other branches (like a hypothetical `testing-branch` or feature branches)  was discussed or demonstrated. Such branches are crucial for:

*   **Isolation:** Developing new features or trying out experiments without destabilizing the `main` branch.
*   **Collaboration:** Allowing multiple individuals to work on different features concurrently.
*   **Code Review:** Facilitating discussions and reviews of changes before they are merged into the `main` branch via Pull Requests.

The concept of `testing-branch` (branches) in this remote repository is a cornerstone of collaborative Git workflows.

## Collaboration Demonstration

This repository, potentially with the use of different branches, would have served to illustrate:

*   How to clone a repository.
*   How to create branches for new work.
*   How to make changes and commit them.
*   How to push changes to GitHub.
*   How to open Pull Requests to propose changes.
*   How to merge Pull Requests after review.

## How to Use This Repository (for Session Attendees)

If you attended the session, you might have:

*   Cloned this repository to your local machine.
*   Created your own branches to practice Git commands.
*   Made changes to the files and pushed them to your own fork or a specific branch.

This repository serves as a reference point for the concepts discussed during the session.
